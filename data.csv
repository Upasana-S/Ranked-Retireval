"experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of awing in a slipstream ."	"experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of awing in a slipstream .  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream wasmade in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the liftincrease due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wingand at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  theresults were intended in part as an evaluation basis for differenttheoretical treatments of this problem .  the comparative span loading curves, together withsupporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift incrementproduced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ orboundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining liftincrement, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agreewell with a potential flow theory .  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made forthe specific configuration of the experiment ."

(a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemicalreaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusionacross streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which thevolume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas densitynear the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the densityjust outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnationenthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in themore familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, incase (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface isrepresented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradientvalue, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtaineddirectly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order toillustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special casesof an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by aspherical segment .in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling thediffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as thelow-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replacedby the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) arealso applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rateis similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heattransfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case ofthermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .)when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable valueof atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 .additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearlyrequired before these simple results are accepted ."

"wakes in axial compressors .the tendency in the past has been to assume thatwhen wakes or non-uniform total head profiles arefed into an axial compressor then substantially constantstatic pressure prevails at the entry, the variations in totalhead appearing as variations in velocity .  this variationin velocity causes variation in incidence on the early stageblade rows and thus can give rise to excitation of bladevibration .  this assumption is implicit, for instance, inreferences 1 and 2, but we think has been a commonassumption by most of the people working in this field .  where the compressor is fed by a duct of substantiallyparallel walls for a reasonable length ahead, such anassumption appeared justifiable .  such a duct when givenan air flow test with its outlet discharging, for instance,to atmosphere instead of to the compressor, then thedistribution assumed would normally be obtained and in factmany surveys of such ducts have been represented in thisfashion .  the object of this note is to show that, in fact,this distribution will not normally occur when thecompressor is present and we may normally expect much morenearly a constant velocity into the compressor withattendant static pressure distributions to match with the totalhead variations ahead of the intake, with of course, theattendant curved flow to support the static pressuregradients ."

"oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonichypersonic strip theory .  the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool forconducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of theshock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooledboundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .  boundary-layer transition investigations have been made onoptically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylindermodels with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 androughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) .transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates onthe model surface .  the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristicfeature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on ahemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over theentire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies thattransition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transitionreynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outeredge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in thesonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transitionoccurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylindermodel at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynoldsnumber, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindricalportion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided anextension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooledhemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transitionreynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were ofthe same order of magnitude as the minimum transitionreynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  theresults indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layercooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies witha highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transitionreynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary-layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurredat a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000based on local external properties and a distance along the bodysurface from the stagnation point) .  the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared tobe an important parameter affecting the magnitude of thereynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in thetransition reynolds number with increased boundary-layercooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynoldsnumber on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on thehemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number withan increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significantfor the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder ."

"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speedsand methods for fixing transition in model experiments .  the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonicspeeds arise from differences between the conditionsunder which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and inhow they behave after separation .  for turbulentboundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatlyas the reynolds number is changed and in manyexamples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulentlayers that occur naturally at high reynolds numberand for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixedartificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunneltests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often beminimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow byintroducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced byexcrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that theeffects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers thanfor the turbulent layers that are likely to be encounteredat full scale, makes it all the more important to do this wheneverpossible .  several methods which can be used to fix transition are described,and the results obtained by using them are compared .in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreementis found, and explanations can be advanced forcases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties anddifficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussedand illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is neededin interpreting the results obtained with transitionfixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10based on local chord for wings of about 0.1thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinnerwings) .  the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increasedfor three-dimensional wings, particularly if they areswept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynoldsnumber near the tip) and if the tests cover a large rangeof incidence including high incidences for which the flow mayseparate from very close to the leading edge .  underthese circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place theexcrescences at different chordwise positions for low andhigh angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice .more research is needed before sound recommendationscan be made as to how and where transition should be fixedon such models, particularly since in routine testing, it isoften not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully .  in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examplesare given of the spurious results that have been avoidedsuccessfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where evenat low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transitionmay not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer aheadof the shock, and of the conditions under which thereare some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transitionhave been satisfactory ."

(2) there alwaysexists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  asimilar result was obtained by synge from energyconsiderations .  synge found a limiting curve below which themotion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of theasymptotic behavior of the curves shows furtherthat there always exists a maximum value of a beyondwhich the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hencethe qualitative shape of the curve is determined .  the author proceeds to show that simple approximateexpressions for the stability limit can be obtained from hisgeneral analysis for a given velocity profile .  theseapproximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasiusflow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynoldsnumbers are based on the width of the channel and thedisplacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the methodfor computing the complete instability curve is presentedand the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem workedout in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had beengiven before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present moreexact computations agree well with tollmien's result as faras the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned .the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve forpoiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  theminimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  theagreement with the estimate from the simple criterionmentioned above is thus very good .  a discussion of the physical significance of the viscouseffects and of future developments concludes the paper ."

"turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed bodyat hypersonic speeds .  at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscidwake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosedbody at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusionand conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formedby the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed fromthe body surface when the boundary layer separates from thesurface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallowsenthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outerinviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if itbehaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initialvalue near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag ofthe body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flightvelocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of theturbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similarturbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurementsof wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in theregion from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body .tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in thewake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speedcase, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients .  in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such aselectron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, thetwo limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and purediffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated form = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for thecase of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulentradar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters foruhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that thewidth of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasmarequency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 bodydiameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude .these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can considerincluding the effects of finite chemical and electron-ionrecombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more completepicture of the wake at hypersonic speeds ."

"stable combustion of a high-velocity gas in a heatedboundary layer .  it is generally recognized that stable combustion processes inheated boundary layers may be achieved by either of twoconceptual mechanisms .  in one mechanism it is pictured that the heattransfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certaindistance from the surface .  the equality between the flow velocityand the normal burning velocity at this quenching distancedetermines the position of the propagating flame .  in the secondmechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides acontinuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hotrecirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuousignition to the gas flowing around it .  in this case it is thecharacteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determinesthe position of the flame .  all experimental work reported to date has been concerned withconditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable .in the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that showunder what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism providesthe appropriate model and also how the two models are related .to differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up tostudy flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers over awall heated in the form of a step function .  with a turbulentboundary layer and a wall temperature above 1,700f., thecharacteristic time was found to be a systematic and reproduciblevariable .  these observations led to the conclusion that acontinuous ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heatedturbulent boundary layers .  a rational explanation is made for thetransition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicablein unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminarboundary layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heatedturbulent boundary layers .  as a further verification of the continuous ignition mechanisman apparent ignition energy was found .  the logarithm of the heatadded at the lower stability limit was found to be a linear functionof the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperature .  the activationenergy derived from this arrhenius type of relation agreedreasonably well with the estimated value for the fuel used ."
